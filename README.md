# TruckMap Web/CSS Engineering Challenge

This project is intended to touch a few key technologies that TruckMap uses for its web applications to help us understand how you think about trade-offs between time, usefulness, and simplicity in a realistic setting.

We are respectful of your time. If we’ve requested you do this challenge we’ll pay **$200 for any submission** in good faith effort, regardless if you’re ultimately hired.

## Project Description

You will build a responsive, single page [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) app of a fictional SaaS app homepage using [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com) to style the UI.  The design of the single page is attached below. The page should be responsive for [desktop](/designs/design-desktop.png?raw=true) and [mobile](/designs/design-mobile.png?raw=true).

![Design Desktop](/designs/design-desktop.png)

## Requirements

- Create a blank NextJS project, which is set up to use tailwind.css and purge any unused tailwind style classes.
- Links and buttons on the page should have a hover state (see [designs](/designs/design-buttons.png?raw=true))
- The "Why Us?" menu dropdown should be functional and animate/fade in, using React hooks or Recoil to store the hover visibility state.
- Image assets for the page are included in the [/assets](/assets) folder.
- Separate the UI into reusable components so common items and styles aren't duplicated.

## What We're Looking For

- Tailwind is appropriately used to style the UI, with mobile layout breakpoints to make the page responsive.
- The mobile slide-out menu does not need to be functional.
- The UI follows the designs as closely as possible (to resemble implementing designs from a designer).
- Common UI elements are put into separate components to reduce repetition.

## Getting Started

Create a new Next.JS package and install tailwind as a dependency.  Install any other dependencies you'd like to use.

## Submitting

- Zip and email your NextJS repo to us. You can remove `node_modules` before zipping to reduce size.
- We will provide constructive and timely feedback on your submission with a clear direction around next steps.  Thank you for your time.
